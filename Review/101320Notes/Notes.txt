Rick and Morty ICA WPF
	When creating a new window: Paste elements from previous window to new window.
	
	In the code of the new window update the source of the img and update the content of the label.
	Use a method to accomplish this.

	You can make a public reference to the class at the top of mainwindows.cs
	
	public Character character { get; set; } *at the top
	
	or
	
	public void Setup(Character c)
	{
	
	}

	code example
	public void Setup(Character c)
	{
		character = c;

		Uri uri = new Uri(character.image);

	}

	Put code in the selection changed event
	
	Using a method to pass in the value
		creates an instance of the new window in the old window
		CharacterInfoWindow infoWindow = new CharacterInfoWindow();
		infoWindow.Setup(selectedCharacter);
		infoWindow.Show();

	public void Setup()
	{
		Character selectedCharacter = (Character)cboCharacters.SelectedItem;
		CharacterInfoWindow infoWindow = new CharacterInfoWindow();

	}
